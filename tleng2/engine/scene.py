"""
Scene handler
It justs puts the stuff on the screen and it handles the <scene changes> like menu->game->pause screen etc.
Idea:
SceneHandler will get layers, that the dev can assign multiple scenes to play.
Scene will just handle the updates of the objects that it draws. After they were updated and drawn to the buffer screen then they will be flipped and start again onto the next frame.
Scene should also change the scene state when neceasery.

SceneHandler should recognise the state of the app for the right scene to play.

Pseudo code:

scene_dict = menu : menu_scene, game : game_scene  ...
game_state = menu

gameloop
    scene_phase(game_state)
    clock.tick(fps)
    buffer.flip()

fn scene_phase:
    sceneloop
        events()
        update()
        render()
